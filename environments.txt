fire-place (1)
As you approach the fire-place, it seems to be growing, morphing.. By the time you reach it, it has grown to the size of a carriage! (Obvious Exits - 'back', 'fire-place-door')

It's remarkably like a huge carriage!

fire-place-door (2)
Stepping inside this... fire-place/carriage, you have a tremendous sense of what it felt like to be Cinderella! Looking about, you notice much soot and a chimney in need of 'sweep'ing. (Obvious Exits - 'out')

sweep (3)
Having no broom, you pull off your shirt and start whipping it at the dust smothered chimney... The dust quickly cyclones around you to where you can't see anything! After a few minutes of trying to breath through your shirt and let the dust calm you realize your not in a fire-place anymore, but in a ... classroom? There are 'desks', a white board, and a tube 'tv' on a cart where the teacher would sit. (Obvious Exits - 'window' - 'door')

look at tv
... It's Mr. Merrill! He's fidgetting, trying to make the best use possible of his chair pillow
look at window
It appears to be a sunny blue sky day out there. A very tempting exit
look at door
It looks solid.
end

window (4)
Summoning courage you close your eyes and say to yourself "yolo... yolo... yolo". Before you can talk yourself out of it, you begin running at the window and jump through it!... Waking up in a white room what is apparently hours later, you think to yourself "safety first next time". (Obvious Exits - 'situp', 'give-up')

door (5)
The door gives you some trouble, but slowly gives way. Walking down the halls of this school you see lockers (one catches your eye in particular), a big clock, a banner for class president. (Obvious Exits - 'locker', 'emergency_exit')

look at clock
Oh it's really ticking away... and it's late, JEeeeze
look at banner
Corey Mathews for Class President? Says free stuff for everyone if he wins? Makes sense to me!
look at emergency-exit
Feels like it might... have an alarm... But you are a rebel aren't you...
